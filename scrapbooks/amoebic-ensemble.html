<h1>The Amoebic Ensemble</h1>

<p>The Amoebic Ensemble, founded by accordionist Alec K. Redfearn, evolved out of an earlier group called 
Space Heater. Originally just 2 bass players and a percussionist, the band went on to experiment with multiple horn assaults, 
chamber-esque arrangements, and occasional punk-inspired chaos. I played trumpet for the Amoebics from 1994 through 1997.</p>

<p>We released two CDs:</p>

<p>Here's how Jonathan Thomas described the Amoebics in a press release:</p>
<blockquote></i>
<p>Take Raymond Scott, pair him up with Fred Frith, Captain Beefheart, maybe some guys from a French prog rock band. Send them to the Balkans, or Mardi Gras, with a stop along the way at a rollicking Irish pub or a noisy Soho improv club. Then find a batch of musicians who can, and do, play the music that could result from such a sonic fantasy. A group whose influences and experience include classical, medieval folk, hardcore punk and beyond: the Amoebic Ensemble.</p>
<p>The release of "Driving Music," their first single, is the culmination of the instrumental group's freely permutating early history. In 1991, the band took up residence at AS220, Providence's uniquely successful artist-owned gallery / studio / performance space. It was in this fertile environment that composer Alec K. Redfearn was able to meet up with the like-minded musicians and composers who moved in and out of the band in the ensuing years.</p>
<p>Originally just two bass players and a percussionist, the band went on to experiment with multiple horn assaults, chamber-esque arrangements, and the occasional all-out noise fest. The current lineup has proved itself the most cohesive and versatile. The Amoebics' activities this year include scoring a multi-media production with Providence's acclaimed Perishable Theatre (inspiring the music on the single), composing and performing a piece with the Groundwerx Dance Company, holding up the musical end of Rhode Island's Pan-Twilight Circus, and flooring Northeastern rock club audiences more accustomed to guitars, vocals, and three chords. Their first CD, "Limbic Rage," will be coming out in May 1995 on Over the Counter Records.</p>
<p>Thanks to strong melodies, ample hooks, and excellent musicianship, the Amoebic Ensemble makes the seemingly esoteric sound like a romp through a Warner Bros. cartoon. Or an acid trip down Bourbon Street. Or a week-long grappa party in Greece. Or...let your ears decide what strange place the sounds of the Amoebic Ensemble can take you. It's sure to be somewhere out of the ordinary.</p>
