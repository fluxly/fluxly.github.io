<h1>AS220 Labs Drawbot</h1>

<p>
Two motors, some monofilament, a binder clip, a Sharpie and an Arduino-compatible controller. 
		It draws cubic Bezier curves, circles, and can move from one point to another accurately. 
		This drawbot was inspired by Tristan Perich's 2005 installation in the AS220 stairwell.
