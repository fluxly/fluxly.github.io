<p><i>From The Providence Phoenix, May 2007:</i></p>

<p>With their distinct skills, the two Rhode Island natives (Searle is from Exeter, Wallace from Portsmouth) have each found a satisfying calling through their work at AS220.</p>

<p>Wallace, 37, who has been on the staff of the arts organization for 13 years, learned of it while studying computer engineering at the University of Rhode Island, and continued to gravitate toward it after graduation, Searle, who declined to identify her age, spent time developing affordable housing in the Boston area before returning to the Ocean Mate, settling in Providence, 20 years ago</p>

<p>As Wallace describes it, people have come to AS220 with ideas for different projects ever since it moved into its current Empire Street digs in 1994. Nothing really made sense until the Dreyfus, which, he says, Will effectively double AS220's institutional capacity.</p>

<p>
    The project was set in motion a few years back when Searle, Bert Crenca, AS220's artistic director, were having lunch with Dan Baudouin, executive director of the Providence Foundation, who asked when the nonprofit was going to do another build-ing. A seties of talks ensued with John Bowen, the president of Johnson & Wales University, which owned the vacant Dreyfus property, and who served at the time as president of the Providence Foundation (whose mission is focused on promoting downtown).
    With aid from the Providence Economic Development Partnership and Bank of America (which bought three types of tax credits for the effort and offered a $3.2 million construction bridge loan), the effort took flight, Other key participants included the architecture firm of Durkee Brown Viveltos Werenfels and general contractor Trac Builders.

<p>A certificate of occupancy was obtained in March, aboot a year after construction began, and the Dreyfous wil be ready for occupancy on May 1. The incoming, tesidents include artists, musicians, and theatre people.</p>

<p>Like any good team, Wallace and Searle can complete each other's sentences and almost intuit the other's thinking. Beyond the benefits for the Dreyfus residents and the surrounding community, the project has ffered tvaluable experience that might aid the duo in future endeavors.</p>

<p>Right now though, the Dreyfus stands as a prime example of how the thoughtful reuse of an older building can bring more vitality to downtown Providence. </p>

<p>Searle, who grew up on a farm in Exeter, touts this kind of development as a broader example for the state. The way to preserve open space areas, she says, is by having intelligent reuse and vibrant development in Rhode Island's cities. </p>
