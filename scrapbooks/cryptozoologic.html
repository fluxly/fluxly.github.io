<p>Cryptozoologic is a collection of puzzling synths. A new instrument can seem like a puzzle, especially in the realm of modular electronic instruments. Cryptozoologic embraces this nature of synths and provides big and bizarre sounds once you figure out how to tease them out.
</p>
<p>
With the initial release you get three synths: Shempscape (bytebeat shufflebox), Nessie (rungle synth) and the Irish Yeti (Euclidean polyrhythms). Playing hints are provided in-app. You can also go deeper at cryptozoologic.org, which guides you through the backend of each synth.

<p>
Cryptozoologic is based on Fluxly technology, a musical physics looper where you create new instrument scenes by moving and spinning colorful Fluxum sound sample players. Cryptozoologic expands on Fluxly (fluxly.com), where the Fluxum controls can also be constrained as sliders, or act as inputs based on their on-screen coordinates.
