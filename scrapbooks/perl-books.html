	<h1>Perl Books for O'Reilly</h1>
	<p>In 1998 I wrote <i>Programming Web Graphics</i>. It's about how to write programs that generate graphics destined for the web. It was published by O'Reilly in early 1999. </p>

	<p><i>Perl Graphics Programming</i> was published in 2003 and shows how to generate GIFs, JPEGs, PNGs, SVGs, and PDFs using Perl and free software. Also SWF (Flash) files!</p>
	<p>I also contributed three chapters to the Perl Resource Kit in 1997.</p>
