<h1>Street Signs</h1>

<p>
Street sign blanks can be found for about $12. I've always said that the Fab Lab isn't a sign shop, but it is basically just a sign shop.

<p>During the 2015 Fab Academy session we had some recitations with featured guests. <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/208666503">Olafur Eliason hosted a couple of 
sessions</a> and assigned some homework where we were to explore smiles as a graphic element. I added the classic 
"have a good day" smile to Big Friend and mounted it on a street sign to document the reactions.
