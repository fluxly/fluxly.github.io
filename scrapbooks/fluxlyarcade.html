<h1>Fluxly Arcade</h1>

<p>This game is an entry in the October 2021 Ludum Dare. 
    The Ludum Dare theme was "Unstable", so the physics model for the pachinko pin board is the size of a building balanced on a fulcrum at the center of the screen. Here's how it was described:
</p>
<blockquote><i>
This is a port of Fluxly Arcade, the default game for the Snoofy System 7 fantasy console. <br/>
Fluxly arcade is based on Fluxly technology. <br/>
Fling your fluxum into the pachinko machine and score points. <br/>
Liberal use of the Tilt button is encouraged to free your fluxum.
