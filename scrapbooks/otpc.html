<h1>One Theremin Per Child</h1>

<p>An open source project to create a sub-$30, quality theremin. With all due respect for the <b>One Laptop Per Child</b> program, the OTPC acronym can also expand to "Obligatory Theremin Parts Collection".</p>
<p>The <a target="new" href="http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenTheremin/">Open Theremin</a> project from Gaudi Labs is the closest anyone has got so far. Here's a prototype we made from the Gaudi designs back in 2015.</p>
