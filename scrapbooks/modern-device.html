	Paul Badger started Modern Device to fill the electronics needs of his classes at RISD. Modern Device came 
		out of working with design students, looking at the problems they faced in class and building kits that made it 
		cheaper and easier to work with electronics. He started kitting in his basement in 2007 and moved to a 500 sq ft 
		commercial space at the Steel Yard in 2010. Modern Device grew out of that space and moved to the Hope Artiste Village in 2012.
