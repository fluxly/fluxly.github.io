	<div class="description">This is a port of Fluxly Arcade, the default game for the Snoofy System 7 fantasy console. Fluxly arcade is based on Fluxly technology; fling your fluxum into the pachinko machine and score points. Liberal use of the Tilt button is encouraged to free your fluxum. </div>
	<div class="description">This game is an entry in the October 2021 Ludum Dare. The Ludum Dare theme was "Unstable" so the physics model for the pachinko pin board is the size of a building balanced on a fulcrum at the center of the screen.</div>
